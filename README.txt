The user must use a valid RMIT email (email@rmit.edu.au) to register an account before they can use
other functions of the site.

Due to the limitation of my implementation, you will need to enter the url
yourself to access to other user's profile, blog.

URL parameters:
Blog: http://localhost:3000/blog/email@rmit.edu.au
Profile: http://localhost:3000/profile/email@rmit.edu.au

Change the email part to the email of the user you want to visit
