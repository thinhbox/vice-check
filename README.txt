COSC2758 (semester 2, 2021) 
Assignment 1

Student ID: s3752794
Student Name: Thinh Quoc Le

Completed tasks:
Every task from begin to DI part: Welcome, Signup, Login, Posting

Used libraries, add-ons:
Formik, React Router, React Bootstrap, Font Awesome.
The data is saved in localStorage.
Should use an rmit email for testing(s1234567@student.rmit.edu.au).

Known Bugs:
The navBar won't re-render in some cases. I temporarily fix this problems by force refresh in the React Router.

Problems in Development:
Formik and Bootstrap just not work well with each other and required some workaround.
Have some problems when moving from OPP to functional programming (use function instead of class for components).
The concept of states and props, hooks.
The design/style of the website has been changed various times.
